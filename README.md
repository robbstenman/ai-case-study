# Tortuga Agtech

## Overview and Origin

Tortuga Agtech is a Denver-based start-up that is developing an autonomous harvesting robot that can pick strawberries and other soft fruits. The robots can also assist with pest control and data collection which assists with forecasting. The company was started in 2016 by Eric Adamson, Co-founder and CEO, and Tim Brackbill, Co-founder and CTO.[^1]

### Company Origin
In a March 1, 2022 Blog post, Eric Adamson explains how the company was founded:

>Our CTO Tim and I started Tortuga nearly 6 years ago with a clear mission: to build a healthier society, and a thriving planet, through smarter farming. A broad mission, to be sure, but the drive to tackle it comes naturally to us, as both of us trace our roots back to farming. My grandfather grew up on a dairy farm in Ontario, while my grandmother homesteaded with her family, growing market crops in Western Australia. Tim’s earliest memories of engineering were of “helping” his grandfather fix broken tractors on his farm in Pennsylvania. We took our passion for agriculture and dove head-first into the process of building, learning, and continuous improvement.[^2]

### Company Funding

According to *Crunchbase*:

>Tortuga AgTech has raised a total of $28.6M in funding over 6 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Apr 8, 2021 from a Series A round.[^3]

While most of the investment has come from private early stage venture capital funds, specifically Lewis & Clark AgriFood with $20M, they have received $1,225,000 from the National Science Foundation.[^3]

## Business Activities

### Problem Solving
The primary value proposition for Tortuga Agtech is that using robots to pick strawberries and other soft fruit will save the farm money by replacing or augmenting human labor. Picking strawberries is very labor intensive and can account for for up to 50 to 60 percent of variable costs of harvesting.[^4]

### Customers and Markets
The ideal customer is a tabletop strawberry farm. The robots have been optimized to succeed in an arranged environment, such as tabletop growing as opposed to berries planted in the ground. This means they are not going after the entire soft fruit market, but are focusing on the "Controlled Environment Agriculture" segment.[^5]

According to a September 23 report by Research and Markets:

>The global smart harvest market, valued at $4.17 billion in 2022, is expected to reach $7.74 billion by 2028, exhibiting a robust CAGR of 10.5% during the forecast period (2023-2028). This growth is primarily driven by the agricultural industry's growing emphasis on achieving higher crop yields while minimizing input costs. Smart harvest technologies offer precise and targeted approaches for production management, optimized harvesting application, and effective harvesting. By enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions, enhance operational efficiency, reduce resource wastage, and mitigate environmental impact, these technologies are poised to fuel the expansion of the global smart harvest market in the coming years.[^6]

### Competitive Advantage

Tortuga Agtech recently won the Ag Robot of the Year 2024, presented by World FIRA, the International Forum of Agricultural Robotics. The publication Future Farming wrote in their February 8, 2024 edition that:

>One of the main arguments why the jury chose Tortuga AgTech as the winner is the fact that the harvesting robot addresses one of the most significant challenges faced by agricultural businesses: the shortage of affordable and skilled labour. The jury was also impressed by its ability to harvest multiple types of fruits with a single robotic harvester. This machine transforms what was only a vision a few years ago into a reality. It demonstrates how ag robots are the future, making predictions come to life and inspiring others to explore the possibilities. It’s highly practical, offered on a service contract basis at a cost equivalent to hiring labour. Its real value lies not in labour savings but in providing a solution to the industry’s labour crisis. Some farmers have ceased crop production due to the lack of harvest staff. Additionally, its versatility shines as it not only harvests and transports crops but also treats them with UV light, trims runners, and logs essential data.[^7]

### Current Technology
The robots rely heavily on AI to perform their tasks. A recent job posting for a Software Engineer, listed as requirements in-depth knowledge of PCBs, experience with microcontrollers, FOC motor control, TCP/IP communications and strong C++, C and Python proficiency[^8]. 

According to a January 29, 2024 article in Future Farming:

>The robots have an autonomous base that navigates up and down the row and two arms that identify, move and pick fruit. The robot’s AI uses nearly twenty “models” to make picking decisions, relies on advanced software for two-arm picking and navigates in the row precisely.[^9]

## Landscape

### Company Field

Tortuga Agtech is in the agricultural robotics field and specifically in the smart harvesting area.

### Major Trends

There is an article in *Wired* titled "The Elusive Hunt for a Robot That Can Pick a Ripe Strawberry" published on February 16, 2022. The opening paragraph states:

>Ten years ago, a company called Agrobot demonstrated a strawberry-harvesting robot in a field in Davis, California. Today, Agrobot’s strawberry picker remains a prototype.[^10]

Further down in the article, it says:

>A recent study reviewed nearly 50 harvesting robot projects from 2000 to 2020 and found that harvesting robots have yet to see widespread use, in large part because most robots still can’t do a better job than a human.[^10]

This is about to change with the adoption of AI, more compute power than before, and better cameras and sensors.

### Competitors

There appear to be three main startup rivals to Tortuga Agtech. 

Saga Robotics AS https://sagarobotics.com/

Advanced Farm Technologies https://advanced.farm/

Dogtooth https://dogtooth.tech/[^11]

Other companies were listed as competitors, but upon further research, they were not direct competitors in the soft fruit picking category.

## Results

### Business Impact

Revenue data is not available for Tortuga Agtech. However, an indicator of their potential is that Lewis & Clark AgriFood invested $20M in 2021. 

“We have been looking at the robotics and automation space for a while, and got to know Tortuga shortly after they closed their last round. As we tracked their progress, we became further and further convinced that they are the most exciting and commercially viable robotic harvesting company on the market. We believe Tortuga can be the world leader in on-farm technology and automation,” Larry Page, managing director of Lewis & Clark AgriFood, told AFN.[^12]

### Key Metrics

From a *Precision Agriculture* article titlted "Intelligent robots for fruit harvesting: recent developments and future challenges", published June 2, 2022, the 3 key performance metrics for commercial feasibility are[^13]:
*harvest success rate
*cycle time
*damage rate

The startups in this field have not published their results so it is difficult to determine how they measure up to their own metrics.

### Competitive Performance

The startup competitors do not share their revenue or financial data, so it is difficult to say which company is in the lead. However, Tortuga Agtech winning the Ag Robot of they Year 2024 is a good indicator that their solution is deemed better than their competitors.

## Recommendations

### Suggestions

1. Once the company is profitable, look for partnerships with other agricultural robotics companies for licensing opportunities. For example, there is a company called Carbon Robotics which sells a Laserweeding system.[^14] Licensing the weed identification and laser technology seems like a natural fit for Tortuga Agtech. It could be integrated into their robot while not taking R&D resources away from the developing the picking technology.

2. In certain greenhouse environments, farmers may be able to continually grow strawberries or other soft fruits, and the robots can be used year round. In other cases, the farm may only have one or two harvests per year. In order for the robots to not sit idle, I'd recommend building future editions of the robots so that they can be quickly and easily broken down for shipping. For example, easily romove the wheels, easily detach the arms. Then develop a custom hardshell case that would fit all the robot components. Design the cases to be stackable and fit inside a shipping container, this way the robots can be deployed to another farm and another harvest.

### Benefit the Company

Once the robots can pick soft fruit better and cheaper than human labor, then it is time to add features. Laserweeding would be a selling point to organic farmers that don't want to use pesticides. Being able to easily transport robots from farm to farm will add significant revenue to Tortuga Agtech.

### New Technologies

As noted on the Laserweeding website:

>Recent advances have unlocked the industry-reshaping potential of AI powered robotics – specifically the combination of computer vision, AI/deep learning, and robotics[^14]. 

The ability to protect the robots during transport does not utilize any new technologies.

Identifying and implementing relevant new technologies will be critical in Tortuga Agtech's success. They currently have 5 patents and 6 pending patents.[^15]
